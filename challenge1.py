# Challenge 1
# Implement the Graph ADT with an adjacency list
# Implement code to read in a graph from a text file to create an instance of the Graph ADT and use it's methods.
# Input: A graph file (can contain a directed or undirected graph with or without weights)

# Output:

# The # vertices in the graph.
# The # edges in the graph.
# A list of the edges with their weights (if weighted)
